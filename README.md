Happenstance -- An app to engage you with the neighborhood.
====================================

## DESCRIPTION

Happenstance is an app to engage users with the neighborhood. When a user enters into a geofenced location, he will receive a push notification on the phone. Clicking on the push notification allows the user to view a modal with an interesting sound byte about the history of that location.
